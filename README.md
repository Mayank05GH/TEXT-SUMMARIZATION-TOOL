*DESCRIPTION*: For Task 1 of my CodTech AI internship, I developed an Article Summarization Tool using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The main goal of this tool is to automatically condense long paragraphs or articles into a concise, meaningful summary while retaining the core information and context. This allows users to grasp the key points of lengthy content quickly and efficiently.

To build this tool, I used Python as the programming language and implemented it in Google Colab, which is an online notebook environment provided by Google. Google Colab is ideal for AI tasks because it provides free access to powerful computing resources, including GPUs, and does not require any local installation of heavy libraries. This ensures that my code can be run and tested easily on any device with an internet connection, making the project highly portable and reproducible.

For the NLP component, I used the Hugging Face Transformers library, which is a state-of-the-art open-source framework for working with pre-trained language models. Specifically, I leveraged the summarization pipeline provided by Hugging Face, which internally uses powerful models like BART or T5. These models have been trained on massive datasets and can generate abstractive summaries, which means they understand the text context and generate new sentences instead of simply extracting parts of the original text.

In my Python script, I first imported the summarization pipeline from the Transformers library. Then, I loaded a pre-trained summarization model and fed it with a sample input paragraph explaining what Artificial Intelligence (AI) is, what it aims to achieve, and its potential impact on different industries. The model processed this input and generated a short, coherent summary capturing the essence of the full text.

To demonstrate the output, I chose to capture a screenshot of the running code and the generated summary rather than saving the output to a separate text file. This approach provides a clear, visual proof that the code runs successfully and produces the expected result. Including a screenshot also simplifies the submission process and allows anyone reviewing my work on GitHub to quickly verify the input and output in one glance. The screenshot shows the input paragraph, the generated summary, and the fact that the code executed without errors. This is attached in the repository under the images folder and linked in the README.md.

This task was an excellent exercise in applying NLP concepts and working with pre-trained models in a real-world scenario. It also taught me how to integrate advanced AI models into Python projects and how to test them using cloud-based platforms like Google Colab. Automatic text summarization is widely used today in news aggregation, document summarization, and productivity tools to help users save time and process large amounts of information more efficiently.

By completing this task, I gained practical experience in working with modern AI libraries, handling large models, and creating user-friendly output presentations. The entire project is well-documented and shared through my GitHub repository, which includes the Python script, the detailed README.md, and clear screenshots showcasing the working results, fulfilling all requirements of my CodTech AI internship.
